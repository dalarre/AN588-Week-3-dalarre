## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


##HOMEWORK 02

```{r}

l <- 15 ## This establishes lambda = 15

ppois(8, l, lower.tail = FALSE) ## This returns the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session

dpois(0,l) ## This returns the probability that she will hear no calls in a session

dpois(3,l) ## This returns the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session

#This code plots the poisson mass function of the values of x from 0 to 30
relevant <- 0:30
y <- dpois(x = relevant, lambda = l)
barplot(y, names.arg = relevant, space = 0, xlab = "Number of calls", ylab = "Pr(X = Number of calls)", main = "Probability Mass Function")

##This simulates 104 results from this distribution 
x <- rpois(104,l)
x

## This plots the simulated results
hist(x, breaks = seq(from =0, to = 30, by = 1), probability = TRUE, main = "Plot of 104 simulated results", xlab = "Number of calls", ylab = "Pr(X = Number of calls)", xlim = c(0,30))
## The shape of this plot ressembles the probability mass function, but it doesn`t match perfectly.
